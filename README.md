budget
======
Web-based transactional budgeting software.

A good budgeting tool should be quick to enter entries into, should reward you
when you keep to your budget, and should punish you when you don't.

This project aims to be easily accessed at the POS for immediate recordkeeping.
It has an easy-to-use responsive web interface that allows for quick entry.
Future plans include utilizing local storage to allow transactions to be
entered in offline mode.

Many budgeting systems fail to reward you at the end of the month when you meet
your budget.  As soon as the first rolls over, you are right back at square one
with your standard budget available.  This project makes it easy to have your
budget roll over from month to month, so when you end the month with money left
in your budget, you get that much more to spend on what you really want in the
following month.

Of course this also holds true for the reverse.  That means that if you go over
your budget, you need to tighten the pursestrings the following month to get
back on track.
